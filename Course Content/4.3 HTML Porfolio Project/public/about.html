<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is (I'll fill it in later) I'm an engineering graduate and it system admin who likes to learn about Science
  computers, mechanics, physics, aviation and any practical pursuit in general.
</p>

<p>
  Since I was a kid I've been fixing things, taking them apart, and learning how they work for fun. 
  I attended Georgia tech and graduated with a bachelors in aerospace engineering. 
  While in college I used to volunteer as a bike mechanic and would help others in a little shop on campus.
  I used to mountain bike race in places like Windrock Tennesse and Lindsey Wilson Kentucky.
  I'm an avid gamer, and owe a lot of my knowledge to video games.

  After graduating I worked for a year in a bike warehouse while taking the google data analytics certifcate course and improving my computer science skills overall.
  When I landed a job with my current employer I was exposed to new trainings and technologies such as Java, Dev-Ops, Selenium, Linux, AWS and much more.
  My goal is to advance my career through all of the interdisciplinary talents I gain. Keep evolving, take other with you up the mountain and don't move towards a dead end.
  I've been studying python Machine learning, AI, computer architecture, aviation and web development in my spare time.
  I want to get my pilot's license for cheap and also learn how to make kick-but videogames.
